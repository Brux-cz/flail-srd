Thank you to Isaac Williams for teaching me how to make games, to Karl Druid for the
feedback, to Adriana Oliveira for the love, to the playtesters for withstanding so many
versions of this game, and to all Games Omnivorous fans for the constant support.
This book was written to the sounds of free jazz, stoner rock, and space dub.
Play FLAIL to that soundtrack. Or don’t. It’s your game now.

I’m done with 300-page rulebooks and 35-page
modules. Been there, done that — this is not what
I’m looking for anymore for my gaming table. Don’t
get me wrong: many of those are very dear to me,
and many have provided me with unforgettable
moments over the years. Heck, I’ve even reworked
some to fit my current play style. But overall, I’ve
moved on. Mostly because I wasn’t having fun with
them anymore.
These days I like to prepare little, play fast, and
improvise a lot. I want my players to do the same,
to shape the world alongside me, to surprise me as
much as I surprise them. Some might say this
drifts dangerously close to narrative gaming (‘oh
no! traitor!'), but I don’t see it that way. For me,
keeping things minimalist and improvisational is at
the heart of the old-school (OSR) spirit. Give me
one-page modules any day — dungeons I can run in
two hours, that start and finish in a single session,
yet still leave plenty of room for us to build on and
take the fiction in unexpected, exciting directions.
Throw me good bones: my players and I will give
them flesh.
I know there are games that already kinda do this.
Games like Cairn and Knave. Or Black Hack and
Mythic Bastionland to some extent. Indeed, there’s
no shortage of great old-school-inspired RPGs.
Every year a new one comes out, building on the
last and taking the genre in exciting directions. I’ve
been playing them for over a decade now, and even
worked on a few as a creator, editor or publisher —
Mausritter and Vaults of Vaarn being the betterknown examples perhaps.
But for years I’ve been chasing something that still
wasn’t quite there yet. A game that stays lean and
fast, easy to pick up, easy to run, yet still gives
players enough depth and chance for customisation that a bard or a wizard never feel the same.
That game never quite showed up. So I built on the
2

foundations of minimal prep, rules light, and onepage dungeons, adding just enough crunch and
character depth to make each new party feel different and every character its own thing.
That resolve became the heart of this project. A
playtester once shouted, “This thing is Mausritter
meets DCC!” and yeah, I think that’s fair. It takes the
chaos of DCC and mixes it with the simplicity and
board-gameyness of Mausritter, while adding a
good bit of character depth. Out of that collision
came something else: a push-your-luck essence
that hums beneath the entire game. Playing FLAIL
feels a bit like gambling, pressing on when you
probably shouldn’t, risking everything for one more
roll. It’s a game that puts luck back at the centre of
play in the true old-school spirit - or so I think, at
least.
The system uses a familiar roll-under save system,
but combat is entirely new. I resurrected the traditional To Hit roll and turned it into a game of poker
dice. Players roll a pool of d6s, triggering cool abilities and bonuses when they score pairs, triplets,
sequences, etc. It’s quick, swingy, and a little
addictive. I’ve also removed hit point growth
entirely; it never increases with level. It sounds
cruel, but not really. Characters are fragile, yes, but
they have more tools, tricks, and abilities than
usual. I think this balance keeps the table alive;
every encounter really does matters because it
could go really wrong at any moment — but FLAIL is
not exactly a death buffet.
This is the game I’ve been chasing for years. It’s
fast, dangerous, and unpredictable. Every character
feels different, every roll can wreck your plans, and
somehow that’s exactly what makes it work. I’ve
been wanting to play it for years.
I hope you do too.

THE
Less is More

Characters are defined by just five attribute
scores, four unique skills and their inventory.
That’s it. The attribute scores – Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Charisma and Luck – function just like in traditional RPGs. The skills are
designed to structure classic mechanics that
players expect from their chosen class.
Inventory is intuitive, with gear divided into
three zones – hands, body, and satchel –
encouraging creativity and dynamic play. The
ideas is to focus on gameplay while aiming to
maintain a certain depth.

Customisation

Though minimalist in character design, there is
ample room for personalisation. Each class features at least one highly customisable skill, such
as a wizard’s spellbook, a cutthroat’s guild, a
cleric’s faith, or a tinkerer’s gadget box. This
makes character creation quick while allowing
unique builds and different playstyles
within each class.

4

PHILOSOPHY
Push Your Luck

Risk and reward are key. The more ambitious the
action, the greater the stakes. Wizards can amplify
spell power but risk miscasting. Clerics can cast
indefinitely but might anger their god. Druids can
remain in beast shape as long as they like, but risk
staying in such state permanently. Warriors can perform extraordinary feats, with bolder attempts carrying harsher consequences. The game bears a highrisk, high-reward philosophy.

Gambling

Combat feels like playing poker. Players roll a
pool of six-sided dice, triggering special
bonuses when they hit combinations like pairs,
triplets, full houses, or sequences. These combinations unlock unique effects tied to the
character’s skills and equipment. This keeps
combat always intense, unpredictable and
exciting. Every roll carries the potential for
drama.

Measured Danger

Combat is fast and ruthless, often resolving
within a few rounds, giving the impression
of high danger. However, death is rare.
Characters only die if their hit points drop
to zero and they subsequently roll an 8 on a
d8 table. More commonly, characters take
on scars or debilitating conditions, leaving
permanent marks on their journey. This
keeps combat tense while ensuring that
characters are not constantly removed
from play.

FOR PLAYERS

OF

FLAIL
Fast Pace

Low-Prep

The game offers tools to quickly generate content as needed, allowing gameplay to drive the
narrative. Adventures sites are concise – no
more than ten rooms per dungeon – making
them playable in a few hours. To begin a campaign, the GM needs only to draft a few hexes,
generate some tables, prepare a simple dungeon, and let players find their own adventure,
expanding the setting as the game progresses.

Hexcrawling

The default mode has characters exploring a
world mapped on hexagons, most of which
contain a notable location or landmark. While
it is possible to play meta-plot campaigns or
mega-dungeons using this game, most of its
tools are designed for sand-box, open-ended
hexcrawls, fostering a fast-paced, procedural play.

Treat Hexes like Rooms

The game should give players a sense of progress
and achievement. Instead of lingering in a single
dungeon for multiple sessions, characters are
meant to explore various locations and hexes in a
single session, moving the story forward steadily.
The intention is a gameplay experience where
characters feel accomplished and players see
their actions shape the world.

Improvisation

Locations are only detailed when relevant.
The rules offer procedural tools –
encounter tables, treasure generators, hex
features – to create content as the game
happens. The GM is encouraged to lean on
players feedback, asking questions or even
letting them steer the narrative. (Player: “Is
this city controlled by a guild or an undead
ogre?” GM: “What do YOU think is more
interesting?”). By putting randomness and
collaboration at the centre of gameplay, the
world will feel dynamic and alive, always
evolving in surprising ways.

Dungeon rooms can be as minimal
as “it contains a monster” or “it
holds this trap and treasure”. Think
of hexes similarly. A hex with a
wizard tower can be described similarly, with an obstacle to overcome
(“the wizard wants something!”) and
a reward, like a treasure or a hook.
Uninterested players can move to a
new hex, much like advancing
through a dungeon.

FOR THE GM

5

AND
Rule Zero
Rulings supersede rules. This rulebook only covers
so much, and the in-game narrative will push characters to situations NOT fully addressed in here. In
these situations, the Game Master (GM) will come
up with a solution, like negotiating a dice roll with
the players or allowing them to succeed for a cost
(e.g. ‘you can do this, but you must give up an
item’). Follow the GM’s lead.

Saves: Roll Under
The first core mechanic is to roll a d20 whenever a
character attempts a risky action, trying to roll
under the relevant attribute score. These are called
Saves, and encompass every imaginable action.
The attributes are divided into Strength, Dexterity,
Charisma, Intelligence and Luck. A roll of 1 is always
a critical hit, the best kind of success. A roll of 20 is
always a fumble, the worst kind of failure.

Combat: Roll 1s
The second core mechanic is to roll a bunch of d6s
when in conflict, trying to score as many 1s as possible. This system is used in combat only. It is
called To Hit. The number of d6s a player gets to
roll is determined by their weapon, any relevant
skills or class restrictions, usually between 4-8. If
someone rolls three 1s, they instantly eliminate the
adversary, regardless of how strong they are.

The World
The world of FLAIL is there to be shaped. There’s no
set map or rigid lore - what exists is what is created by playing. The game leans into a gritty, acid
fantasy, where weird spells, ridiculously epic
swords, and odd creatures are the norm. Whether it
starts in a crumbling city, a hazardous wasteland or
a sleepy village, the world will evolve through the
characters' actions and imagination.
6

NOW THE

LAW OF

FLAIL!

Time

Currency

Time is measured in three fundamental ways, each
aligning with a key phase of the game:

Currency is measured in coins. This generic system
ensures compatibility with other games, and keeps
things easy, so players can focus on adventuring
rather than bookkeeping.

• Round: ten seconds long. Enough to take an
action and make a move. Relevant in combat.
• Turn: ten minutes long. Enough to explore a
room, or deal with an encounter. Relevant in the
exploration of an adventure site (typically
dungeon crawling).
• Watch: eight hours long. Enough to enter or
leave a region (usually one hex) or exploring a
location. Relevant when travelling (typically
hexcrawling).
Note: when rounds are mentioned in spells, skills
or effects, these should be treated as individual
rounds taken by one character. Example: a spell
affecting a target for three rounds means it lasts
three of their rounds; a wall of bones lasting two
rounds means the caster can take two rounds
before the spell ends. Adjust as needed organically during play.

Movement
Movement is measured using three fairly abstract
ranges: Near, Distant and Far-Away. These apply
only during combat or conflict, and play almost no
role in other parts of the game.

Language
Language rules are only relevant for discerning
information, not for everyday communication. It is
assumed that characters can speak to each other
and to commoners when travelling. When encountering dead, exotic, or arcane languages, the GM
may call for an INT save to determine whether a
character can read or interpret the information.
These saves should be used primarily for deciphering unusual or obscure writings, and not for day to
day communication.

Inventory
Inventory plays a vital role. Gear is meant to be
used, broken, repaired, and cycled. Unique Items
are powerful, but they can break just as well if used
extensively. Players are responsible for rolling
usage. The same applies for grub, ammo and other
consumables.

Conditions
Conditions are negative effects that have special
inventory cards, which characters must place in an
inventory slot of choice. Conditions are gained from
failed rolls, reckless actions, or unsuccess in conflict. Players are responsible for tracking these
cards and their effects, just as they do with usage.

Spellcasting
Spellcasters decide how much power to channel
into their spells. The effects depend on the number
of dice used, and their rolled sum. For example, the
Floating Disc spell creates a disc with [DICE]
inventory slots that lasts [SUM] turns; this means
that two dice spent of this spell with a rolled sum
of eight creates a disc with two inventory slots for
eight turns.

Searching for Secret Things
When a player character searches for traps, secret
doors or hidden rooms, the GM should roll on their
behalf, keeping the result hidden. This keeps players uncertain whether a failure means they missed
something or there’s nothing to be found at all.

1. CHARACTER CREATION
Class

Hit Points

Roll d8 or choose a class. Each class is defined by
five attributes, four unique skills, gear proficiency,
maximum hit points and different starting gear.
Pick up or print the respective character sheet and
start filling it.

Each class has a fixed maximum hit points, representing the damage a character can endure before
life-threatening danger. Hit points do not increase
with levels, and can only be boosted by magic items
or rare circumstances that alter a character’s
physiology.

Attributes
Attributes are the defining traits of characters.
Each class usually has one or two main attributes,
but all are important in different aspects of play.
Roll 3d6 for each in order, keeping the two highest
dice for a value between 2-12. Then, swap two
attribute scores at will.
• Strength (STR): used to resolve actions that
involve physical prowess, like lifting and knocking
things down, pulling other characters or dragging
heavy objects. It influences inventory slots. It
does NOT influence attacking.
• Dexterity (DEX): used in actions that require
agility, speed and quick reflexes. It is used to
determine initiative. It does NOT influence
attacking.
• Intelligence (INT): used to resolve tasks that
involve cerebral work, logic, studying, accessing
knowledge and evaluating complex situations. It
influences mana/spirit for spellcasters.
• Charisma (CHA): used in actions that involve
social interactions, strength of will and
leadership. It influences many skills, like those of
the Bard.
• Luck: used in situations where the outcome is
unclear, or to determine whether something or
someone is present or intervenes against the
character. It influences religious magic.
8

Starting Gear
Each class has different starting gear as described
in their respective page. Pick up the appropriate
item cards and distribute them amongst body or
satchel slots at will (see more on page 44).

Reputation
Fill the zero dot. Characters start with a neutral
reputation. Depending on in-game actions, this
track can move up or down (see page 59).

Level
Start at level 1. To go up, characters must gain
experience points as described on the Campaigning chapter (page 58). Upon completing level 5,
characters are retired from play and become notable Neutral Player Characters.

Finishing Touches
Choose a name (or find one on page 123). Roll an
instant backstory (or come up with one), update the
sheet accordingly, and refer it to the GM. Study the
special skills.

Start with Pick Pocket talent (Cutthroat).

6

Human musical prodigy raised in an aristocratic milieu who fled home for a more exciting lifestyle.
Start with +50 coins and a family heirloom.

Special Skills
Jack of All Trades
At each level, Bards can add a Cutthroat thieving
talent, a Tinkerer’s gadget or a Wizard spell of their
choice to their repertoire. They may use each once
per day. For spells, the max amount of mana spent
equals the Bard’s current level (miscasting follows
the same rules that apply to Wizards).
Silver Tongue
Bards have advantage in CHA saves that involve
persuasion, influence, or seducing.
Witness Me!
When Bards deal damage to an adversary in a To
Hit roll while also rolling a triplet, they deal an extra
d6 damage and their allies gain +1 To Hit buff in
their next round of combat.
10

Musical Talents
Bards can add one instrument of choice to their
repertoire at levels 1, 3 and 5. These unlock extra
inventory slots reserved for instruments (always
considered worn). Instruments usually take one
inventory slot, but require two hands to play. To
perform, Bards must carry the instrument, make a
CHA save and roll on the instrument’s table:
• Crit Hit: choose any result from table.
• Success: roll d4 in the instrument table.
• Fail: roll d10 in the instrument table.
• Fumble: roll d6+4 in the instrument table.
On a fail or fumble, the instrument cannot be
played again in the same combat or social situation. It is too embarrassing for the Bard.

May summon their Undead Puppet at any time once per day.

6

Shaman who took their life after an apocalyptic vision, but was resurrected by a superior being.

Special Skills
Dark Arts
Bone Whisperers may learn two spells of choice per
level. To cast, they must carry their lantern, spend a
chosen total of spirit, and roll a number of d6s
equal to the spirit spent. Maximum spirit is equal to
INT. The spell effect varies depending on the
number of [DICE] spent, and their rolled [SUM].
Spells always work, but bear risks. If one 6 is rolled,
gain a Drained condition. On two 6s, roll on the side
effects table. On three 6s, turn undead after casting the spell (retire the character).
Spirit Harvesting
Bone Whisperers regain 1 spirit for each sentient
being that is killed Nearby. When Bone Whisperers
slay a non-undead target themselves in a To Hit roll,
they restore spirit equal to target’s remaining hit
points. If two pairs are rolled, they may summon
14

their Undead Puppet. Whenever the Bone Whisperer
is hit, the creature must succeed in a Morale save
or crumbles in ash.
Animate Dead
Bone Whisperers can revive the dead by spending
spirit equal to the target level, and making an INT
save (with disadvantage for creatures of 7+ level).
On a success, the target is raised as an undead ally
with its original abilities for a number of watches
equal to the Bone Whisperer level, after which they
fade in smoke. On a fail, the target is raised, but
acts on its accord.
Speak with the Dead
The Bone Whisperer can ask a fresh human corpse
one yes-or-no question. Only one question per body
is allowed.

Special Skills
Lay on Hands
Clerics can heal other characters by spending a
round touching them, and making a LUCK save. On
a success, they recover a number of hit points
equal to d6 + current level of the Cleric. On a
fumble, they suffer consequences as per the
Cleric’s religion. (Lay on Hands is a Divine Prayer for
fumbling purposes.)
Miracle Call
Once per session, Clerics can beg their God to perform a miracle. They must speak one wish aloud,
thematically appropriate for their deity. Then, roll
d6s equal to the number of words used in verbalising the wish. The miracle always occurs, but the
Cleric must roll for God’s Wrath for each 6 rolled.
The GM is encouraged to interpret the wish in unexpected ways.
18

Celestial Aid
If Clerics roll a full-house in a To Hit roll (regardless
of hitting the adversary), their God appears,
bestowing divine assistance. Choose one:
• Holy Ray: cause d20 damage to one target.
• Full Bless: heal self OR all allies to full health.
• Litany of Clarity: reset fumble range.
Divine Prayers
Clerics have access to all prayers of their religion.
To cast, they must be carrying (or wearing) their
holy symbol and make a LUCK save. On a success,
the prayer takes effect. On a fail, the prayer falters
and the chance of fumbling is increased by 1 until a
long rest is made. On a fumble, roll for God’s Wrath.
(Ex: after three failed prayers, a fumble occurs on a
roll of 17–20 instead of just 20.)

Special Skills
Primal Gifts
Druids start with two primal gifts from any animal
kingdom. When going up a level, they gain two new
gifts of choice. Each gift can be activated once per
day, without requiring a save, and last for a number
of turns up to the Druid’s current level. They cannot
be accumulated with shapeshifting.
Animal Handling
Druids can befriend, tame or mount wild animals by
making a CHA save. If the animal matches the kingdom with the most primal gifts, roll with advantage.
On a success, the animal follows the Druid and
responds to basic orders. This does not grant the
Druid the ability to speak with it nor control it telepathically. If the animal is put in a dangerous situation, it must pass a Morale save or runs away.
26

Shapeshifting
Druids can spend a round to shapeshift into a beast
from the animal kingdom in which they have the
most primal gifts. If tied, roll randomly. When the
Druid reverts to human form, they must make a %
roll (d100). There is a chance of remaining in animal
shape permanently equal to three times the
number of rounds taken as beast (ex: three rounds
= 9% chance). If that occurs, retire the character.
Otherwise, they revert with the same hit points they
had before shifting.
Nature Adept
Druids can manipulate small amounts of fire, water,
earth or air by making a CHA save, but on a fail take
a Drained condition. Druids never get lost in the
environments connected to the animal kingdoms in
which they hold the most Primal Gifts.

Special Skills
Resourcefulness

of 4-6). They can repair usage on non-magical
items by making a DEX save and marking usage on
an item that shares similar materials.
Quick Craft
Tinkerers can cobble together a contraption or trap
by spending one turn. They must discard appropriate items to use as components, declare the intention with the invention and roll DEX. On a success,
the invention works as declared. On a fumble, it
works against the player characters.

Gadget Belt
Tinkerers start with a belt holding four gadgets of

of any type to their belt. To launch a gadget, Tinkerers must mark usage on their belt. Whenever they
roll a triplet on a successful To Hit roll, they can
release one for free.
Construct Companion
Tinkerers have a construct ally. At each level, they
unlock five construct points to spend on improvements, including at first level. It is only possible to
spend two points on the same improvement per
level. The Tinkerer controls the construct at will,
who regards them as their master. The construct
only comes to life if the sparkle of life item card is
in one of its inventory slots.

* The improvements that do not read +1 means gaining such
ability permanently.

Fixing
Tinkerers can restore their constructs two hit
points by spending a turn working on them and
marking usage on two other appropriate items.
They must roll a DEX save. On a fail, the action is
wasted entirely. Alternatively, they can discard
one item to restore four hit points immediately
without making a save.
Breaking Down
A construct that loses all its hit points is broken,
and loses one improvement of the player’s choice
permanently. Tinkerers must spend a number of
days equal to the construct’s hit points to put it
back together. Each point restored costs 100
coins in parts and components.
Reassembling
A Tinkerer can drop one construction point permanently to reshape their construct entirely.
Each pointed moved to another improvement
costs 100 coins in spare parts and components.
32

Shape & Inventory
A construct’s inventory is divided into two areas:
carried and stashed. Carried items are ready to
use, while stashed items require one action to be
retrieved. The player decides their construct’s
exact shape, size, movement (walking, rolling, sliding), and how it carries or stores items. Some constructs may have limbs and hands, while others
may unorthodox shapes with gear fixed onto them.
Draw a sketch of the construct to bring it to live.
Attacking
Constructs have a TH and DMG value. Their method
of attack is up to the player’s imagination. A construct can only wield weapons whose TH is equal to
or below the construct’s own TH value. DMG is either
that of the weapon or the construct’s score.
Saves
Use this value whenever the construct is required
to make any attribute save.

Special Skills
Extraordinary Feat
Once per combat, Warriors can attempt a deed, like
severing the head of a monster, or swinging from a
chandelier to knock down an adversary. They must
describe their goal, negotiating with the GM a set
difficulty and a proportional consequence for failing. Then, they roll a d20, adding their STR attribute
plus current level. If the set difficulty is beaten,
they succeed. On a fail, they must take the negotiated consequence.
• Easy: 15-20. Minor consequences, like marking
usage on an item.
• Average: 20-25. Severer consequences, like
taking one or two conditions.
• Mighty: 25-30. Major consequences, like rolling
on the Death Table.
34

Weathered
Once per session, Warriors can ignore one condition (excludes magical or cursed conditions).
Heavy Lifting
Warriors have advantage in STR saves that involve
physical force, such as knocking down doors or
dragging weighty objects.
Combat Talents
Warriors gain one talent per level. At first level, they
must choose a basic one. Upon advancing further
levels, Warriors can either select a new basic talent
from a different tree, or advance within a previously chosen one by selecting an expert talent. A
master talent may only be gained if the corresponding expert skill has already been unlocked.

Special Skills
Master Spellbook
Wizards choose a Master to apprentice under,
starting with three random spells, plus two of their
choice from their Master’s repertoire. When going
up a level, they may add two spells to their spellbook, including one from their Master’s list.
To cast, Wizards must carry their spellbook, spend
a chosen total of mana, and roll a number of d6s
equal to the mana spent. The spell effect varies
depending on the number of [DICE] spent, and their
rolled [SUM]. The mana pool equals INT + current
level, resetting with a long rest. Spells always work,
but bear risks. If one 6 is rolled, they gain a Drained
condition. On two 6s, roll on the side effects table.
On three 6s, they gloriously die after casting the
spell.
38

Read Magic
Wizards can make an INT save to cast a spell from
an arcane writing of any source, or identify the
exact properties of magic items. They can also
learn spells from other spellbooks by spending
downtime (between sessions) studying them and
making an INT save. On a success, they may swap
one spell for the new one.
Alchemy
Wizards can mix potions for one less ingredient
than usual.
Arcane Resonance
If Wizards roll a pair while spellcasting, they
recover mana of the same value of the pair (ex: a
pair of 3s recoups 3 mana).

40

5

6

Fly: caster or ally gains the ability to fly for [DICE] rounds.

7

9

10

Knock: opens sealed doors, gates, chests, and similar from a distance of [DICE] x 3’.

11

Magic Missile: deals [SUM] damage to one single target within Distant range.

12

Mirror Image: creates [DICE] illusory doppelgangers of caster; illusions are dispelled if hit.

13

Polymorph: morphs ally into [SUM]: (1-4) hamster, (5-8) chicken, (9-12) bear, (13-16) giant spider,
(16-19) prismatic slug, (20+) monster of choice; change lasts [DICE] turns, causing twice [DICE]
damage when ally reverts to human.

14

Read Languages: identifies and reads languages for [DICE] turns.

15

Sleep: causes deep slumber to [DICE] targets of combined level [SUM] or less; any harm or excessive noise breaks the spell.

16

Shield: invokes an energy shield on self or ally with half [SUM] hit points.

17

Telekinesis: caster may move an object within [SUM] x 10’.

18

Teleport: caster may teleport between two places within [SUM] x 10’.

19

The Eye: conjure a telepathically-linked, remote eye; lasts [DICE] turns.

20

Time Stop: caster can perform [DICE] - 1 extra rounds immediately.

Side Effects, d10
Tinkering with the arts of the arcane has its perils.
1

‘Master?’: an astral projection of the Wizard’s master materialises and slaps them in the face, disappointed.

2

Rainbow Show: a display of coloured vapours materialises around the Wizard, making them the
target of attacks in the adversaries next round of combat.

3

Tentacles: a tentacle grows on the Wizard’s back. After going up a level, the Wizard learns to
manipulate it as an extra limb: use one body slot as an extra hand. If the Wizard gains a second
tentacle, use a satchel slot as another extra hand yet. Should the Wizard gain a third tentacle, they
become a polypus humanoid. Retire the character if such occurs.

4

The Eye: the Wizard’s body sprouts an extra eye: (1) forehead, (2) chest, (3) palm, (4) nape of the
neck. If the Wizard develops more than two new eyes, they get a penalty To Hit equal to the number
of eyes. It becomes too confusing to see straight.

5

Acid Event: d6+1 holes open in the Wizard’s body squirting jets of acid. Each does 1 point of
damage to the Wizard and to all targets Nearby. If the Wizard survives three of these events, they
become immune to acid.

6

Rough Skin: the Wizard’s skin hardens like a tortoise shell. They gain +1 Defence, but must take an
Exhausted condition after every demanding physical tasks. If the Wizard gains a second rough skin,
they gain another additional +1 Defence, but must take two Exhausted conditions.

7

Crab Claw: one of the Wizard’s arms is reshaped into a giant claw; the process takes d6 days. The
Wizard can only use one arm slot from now on, but the claw counts as TH 5, DMG 3 weapon. If the
Wizard gets a second claw, they can no longer use arm slots, but can make two attacks per round
with their claws. If they get a third claw, it bursts through the head or torso – the Wizard is dead.

8

Polymorph Anomaly: a random ally is transformed into: (1) toad, (2) mosquito,
(3) chicken, (4) bear, (5) gorilla, (6) dragon. Effect lasts a number of turns equal to caster level.

9

Oops Portal: an extraplanar portal cracks open from within the chest of the Wizard, shooting a
random monster of twice caster level from it and then folding onto itself.

10

Brain Fart: roll immediately on the Death table.

41

2. INVENTORY & GEAR
Inventory Slots
Every character has the same number of slots, divided into three main
areas: hands, body and satchel. Depending on where they are, the items
are considered to be carried, worn or stashed. Items usually take one
slot, but bulkier ones may take more slots. It is not possible to carry
more items than available slots.
• Body: items worn on the
body. These can used for
armour, helmet, boots, girdle,
quiver or any additional items/
weapons donned to be readied
quickly. Worn items can be
swapped for carried items as a
free action.

considered to be carried and
may be used at any time.

• Satchel: items placed on the
satchel are stashed. During
conflict, they can be retrieved at
the cost of one action – swap a
carried item for a stashed one.
There are two slots that only
become available if characters
have the respective STR score.

Usage

Conditions

Items have usage dots, usually three. When all are
marked, the item cannot be used until repaired.
Dots on armour and weapons can be cleared for
20% of their original price. Dots on grub, ammunition, torches and similar items are not cleared; new
ones must be purchased.

Conditions are negative effects that characters get
through adventuring. Like gear, they come in
inventory cards and take up inventory slots. When
receiving a condition, players must place it in the
slot of their choice. If there are no empty slots,
they must discard an item.

• Weapons & Ammunition: after a fight, roll d6
for each item that was used. On 4-6, mark a
usage dot.
• Armour: mark usage to downgrade or negate
hits, as per the armour rules.
• Main Item: do not roll usage. These items
should be always available. If, for some reason,
the item is lost or broken, the character must
quest for a suiting replacement.
• Grub: mark usage after eating.
• Light sources: mark usage every six turns.
• Other gear: if used in a way that could harm it,
roll d6. On 4-6, mark usage.

• Effects: conditions can have ongoing effects
like imposing disadvantage.
• Clearing: these cards can only be removed
when their clear requirement is met.
• Dying: if all slots are covered with conditions –
regardless of their type – the character dies.

Note: characters without worn items are still
dressed in any way the player wishes. The body
slots are an abstract currency that limits the
quantity of gear characters can wear for gameplay and conflict purposes. Players can negotiate
with the GM how their characters are wearing or
carrying an item.

Drained

List of basic conditions:
• Drained: gained when performing mentallytasking actions, like spellcasting.
• Exhausted: gained when taking demanding
physical tasks.
• Injured: gained when receiving 6+ damage in a
single hit or from a failed save.
• Persistent Injury: gained from rolling on the
Death Table, or from other in-game conditions
where severer consequences apply.
• Poisoned: gained when poisoned.
• Starved: gained when going without food for
two days. Take one extra starved condition for
each two days that pass thereon after.

** Short bows and crossbow only take one inventory slot, but still require two hands to shoot; the off-hand must be free.
*** Spears take two inventory slots, but are one-handed. A 1-slot item may be placed atop the spear while carried to represent this.

46

Armour
Items that count as armour are marked with an A .
Characters can mark usage on any worn piece of
armour to negate one 1 from a To Hit roll made
against them. They may mark the same piece or
multiple pieces any number of times in the same
round to negate as many 1s as they wish.

Defence vs Armour
Adversaries do not use armour. Instead, they have
a Defence value, which reduces the damage
taken by the shown value on any attack. Defence
refers to this flat damage reduction. Some items/
skills may grant characters a Defence score too.

47

Gear
Gear is not tied to specific rules. It allows characters to perform actions which would otherwise be
impossible – like spying from afar without a spyglass, or climbing a mountain without appropriate
gear. It is part of a player’s duty to negotiate with
the GM how items can confer situational advantages. Similarly, the GM may impose disadvantage
when items are used in unconventional manners.
Some examples to use as inspiration:
• Bedroll: recover additional hit points when
resting.
• Compass: advantage to not getting lost in the
wilderness.
• Fishing gear: disadvantage to fetch an item
from the bottom of the lake.
• Herbs & spices: mark usage and roll LUCK to
recover all or some hit points.
• Maps: place 2d6 new hexes on the map (in
hexcrawl campaigns).
• Medical healing: remove one Injured or
Diseased condition.
• Pickaxe: advantage to digging.
• Portable stove: roll INT to generate a grub
inventory card.
Note: use blank item cards for gear and conditions that come up during play.

48

Optional rule
The GM can ask for LUCK rolls to determine
whether a character is in the possession of pocketsized ordinary items, like dice, coins, or a piece of
chalk. Think of it as something the character forgot
about in a seldom-used pocket.
Scarcity
Villages and small settlements typically offer only
basic items, such as simple tools, rough clothing,
and other essentials. Specialised equipment must
be sought in cities.

3. SAVES
Characters may attempt any actions they wish, except class-specific skills like spellcasting or shapeshifting.
Each class has a set of skills that enhances certain actions, or increase their chance of success, while also
possibly conferring penalties to others. Saves are mostly used outside of combat.

Rolling Saves

Advantage & Disadvantage

Whenever a character takes an action with a
chance of failure – and risky consequences – they
must make a save. Saves are made against the
relevant attribute. Players roll d20. If the result is
equal to or less than the relevant attribute, their
character succeeds. If the roll is higher than the
attribute, they must take consequence for their
actions.

Characters may have advantage or disadvantage to
perform actions depending on skills, gear, class
restrictions, or situational advantages during play
(“I have already been to this city and know some
folk!”). The GM is free to add an advantage or disadvantage whenever it seems fitting.

• Strength: knocking doors down, lifting prison
bars, carrying an obelisk, dragging another
character.
• Dexterity: climbing sheer surfaces, jumping
across a pit, tinkering with delicate objects,
swimming, catching a flying object.
• Intelligence: recalling important information,
searching for hidden doors, reading and
interpreting languages, discerning the
architecture of a building.
• Charisma: rallying folk to a cause, hiring and
retaining hirelings, manipulating or seducing
other characters.
• Luck: determining how fortunate or ill-fated a
situation is, meeting the right person at the right
time, avoiding a rogue arrow.

50

• Advantage: roll two dice and take the lowest
score.
• Disadvantage: roll two dice and take the
highest score.
Note: in the (unlikely) event that a character has
both advantage and disadvantage in the same
action, they cancel each other out. If a character
has more than one advantage or disadvantage,
roll three dice and take the best or worst result,
respectively. No matter how many stack up, the
maximum a player rolls are three dice.

Opposed Saves
If two characters declare the same or a contradictory action, both make saves. The lowest successful
roll wins.

Consequences of Failing
Failing a save does not necessarily mean the action fails, but rather that there is a cost for moving forward. There are three main outcomes. The GM will assess and choose the most fitting outcome.
• Action fails: nothing else happens.
• Action costs: the action succeeds, but there is a cost for its success.
• Action fails + costs: the action fails, and there is a cost for its failure. The GM is encouraged to use
this when a character fumbles.
The costs may include:
• Waste time: nothing bad happens
except that a round, turn or watch goes
by, causing depletion of resources, like
torches or grub.
• Risk encounter: character draws
attention to themselves or their allies,
risking an encounter.
• Take condition: character receives
an appropriate condition. For instance:
failing a running save to escape
combat could result in taking an
Exhausted condition.
• Take damage: character takes an
appropriate amount of damage. For
instance: failing a climb save could
result in taking d4 or d6 damage from
the fall.
• Mark usage: mark usage on an item.
Example: failing to pick a lock could
mean marking usage on the thieves’
tools.
• Discard item: discard an item from
the inventory. Example: failing to open
a door using a crowbar could mean it
broke and the item is discarded.
Saving Throws
Saving throws are special saves that characters must make when surprised by harmful situations
without having the opportunity to take the initiative, such as traps, falling debris, or exposure to poison.
On a fail, the GM chooses the appropriate cost. On a success, the character moves on unscathed.
• Dexterity: area effects, traps, collapsing floors, falling debris.
• Strength: ingestion of poison, exposure to acid, gasses, disease, and similar.
• Charisma: resistance to tricks, manipulation and illusions.
51

4. COMBAT
First, the order of combat is determined. Then, each intervenient may make a move and take one action in
their round. Actions can be used to attack an adversary, cast a spell, fetch a stashed item, aid an ally,
make a second move or any other reasonable action. Combat is designed to be fast and deadly, so avoiding it might be best course of action.

52

Initiative

Movement & Distances

Characters roll a DEX save. Those who succeed act
before adversaries, those who fail act after. This
order is maintained throughout the combat.
Surprise: if a side surprises the other, ignore the
initiative roll. They simply attack first.

Movement and distances are tracked via three
abstract ranges: Near, Distant and Far-Away. These
are used to calculate the relative positions of all
characters in relation to one another. Some
weapons are only effective when Near, whilst
others are better when Distant.

“If it’s near, hit it. If it’s far, make it near.”
- Garruk Marn, the Fighter

• Near: melee weapons; some ranged weapons
work. Less than 30’ away.
• Distant: ranged weapons. More than 30’ away.
• Far-Away: only certain weapons work, like long
bows. Circa 200’ away.

To Hit
Characters roll a number of d6s as indicated by
their weapon’s TH, modified by any class skills or
restrictions, and try to score as many 1s as possible. If the rules mention, for example, “+1 To Hit”
this means that characters roll an additional d6.
Similarly, a “-2 To Hit” means rolling two less d6s.
Important: each class has specialty weapons – if
using any other, characters have a -1 To Hit.
• Minor Hit: when one 1 is rolled, the adversary
loses hit points equal to weapon damage (minus
their defence value).
• Major Hit: when two 1s are rolled, the adversary
loses hit points equivalent to double weapon
damage (minus their defence value).
• Death Blow: when three+ 1s are rolled, the
adversary is instantly eliminated and removed
from play!
• Fail: when no 1s are rolled.
• Fumble: when two or more 6s are rolled
without any 1s being rolled, characters hit an ally
with d8 damage OR mark usage on a carried item.
They choose. (When an adversary fumbles, the GM
determines an appropriate consequence.)

Note: if a player character receives a Death Blow,
they are not outright killed. Instead, their hit
points drop to zero and they must roll on the
Death Table. Good luck.
Important: whenever an attack has a special
effect like Any hit, Major Hit or Death Blow (for
example, the Druid’s beast shape or most of the
creatures in the bestiary), that effect occurs in
addition to default combat consequences. ‘Any
hit’ means the effect occurs with a Minor Hit,
Major Hit or Death Blow.
Poker Dice
Certain skills and Legendary Weapons have
effects that are triggered when ‘poker results’ are
rolled in To Hit rolls.
• Pair: two dice show the same number.
• Triplet: three dice with the same number.
• Poker: four dice show the same number.
• Full-house: a combination of a pair and a
triplet in the same roll.
• Sequence: a series of consecutive numbers
in the same roll.
53

Advantage or Disadvantage
Characters may have advantage or disadvantage,
depending on gameplay circumstances (“I have the
high ground!”). The GM is free to rule it whenever it
seems fitting. Advantage confers +1 To Hit, while
disadvantage imposes a -1 To Hit penalty.
Dual wielding: characters make a second To Hit,
but have disadvantage on both attacks.
Attributes: if the GM wants to add further nuance
to characters, they may rule that those with 13+
DEX have a base advantage to ranged attacks,
and those with 13+ STR have a base advantage to
melee attacks. Conversely, a DEX or STR score of
7- confers a base disadvantage to attacking.

Vulnerability
Those that attempt to target a vulnerable character
or adversary have advantage in their To Hit. Vulnerable characters or adversaries may make a save at
the start of their round. On a success, they recover
and can take their round normally. On a fail, apply
these effects:
• Prone: spend round getting up. Next round act
normally.
• Immobilised: the round is wasted (repeat save
next round). Treat paralysed or grappled similarly.
• Stunned: the round is wasted (repeat save
next round with advantage).
• Blinded: may take one action (no movement),
but any To Hit rolls have a -2 penalty. Repeat save
next round.
Note: sleeping targets can be eliminated outright
(no roll required).

Fleeing
Characters may flee combat by making a DEX save,
unless they are slower than their opponents. On a
fail, adversaries can immediately make an extra To
Hit roll against them.
54

Death
If a character loses all their hit points OR receives a
fourth Injured condition, they must roll a d8 on the
Death table. If outside of combat, they roll immediately. If it occurs during battle, they are put aside,
wait for combat to resolve and then roll. Should the
entire party die, all characters are presumed dead.
1

Near Death Experience: get up with max
hit points restored and +1 to one attribute of
choice.

2

Knocked Out: recover immediately with d4
hit points.

3

Unconscious: out for d3 hours.

4

Hurt: disadvantage on all saves for the
remainder of the session.

5

Scarred: loses 1 CHA permanently.

6

Horrible Wound: gain a Persistent Injury
condition. Cannot be removed from inventory, unless by miracle or magic cure.

7

Maimed: either left or right hand inventory
slot is rendered useless - mark it with an X.
Cannot use two-handed objects. To recover,
must find an artificial arm.

8

Dead!

Note: Injured conditions are not removed by
rolling on the Death Table. Characters must meet
their clear requirements. Any Injuries beyond the
fourth always trigger a Death Table roll.

Recovering
There are three ways characters can rest and
recover. Recovering restores hit points and
removes conditions as follows:
• Short rest: spend one turn resting to restore
d4 hit points.
• Long rest: spend one watch eating and
earning some sleep to restore d4+4 hit points.
• Full rest: spend a week in a safe and familiar
environment to restore all hit points and remove
most long-term conditions.

C O MB AT EX AM P L E
GM: The two of you reach the shattered chapel.
Candles still burn at the altar, the air reeks of blood
and iron. A figure moves — a knight in rusted plate,
helm dented, dragging a long sword: “You trespass
on sacred ground.”
Tess: Oh, we’re definitely running.
Rook: No, wait — look at that blade. That’s relicforged steel. Worth more than our lives.
Tess: (sighs) Fine. I’m covering you. I draw my
shortbow.
GM: The knight rises slowly, joints shrieking in the
silence. You’ve got the drop. What do you do?
Rook: I rush in and swing my axe at his leg — try to
drop him before he can bring that sword around.
GM: Roll to hit. Your axe has TH 5.
Rook: (rolls 5 dice) 1, 1, 3, 4, 6. Two 1s!
GM: Major Hit. Your axe bites into the greaves with
a crunch. What’s your weapon’s DMG?
Rook: 4.
GM: Majors cause double weapon damage — 8 total.
Sparks spray as the knight collapses to one knee,
black oil spilling from the joints.
Tess: I loose an arrow at his head. TH 5. (rolls) 1, 3,
4, 4, 6 — one 1.
GM: Minor Hit. The arrow punches through the visor.
He lets out a scream, then swings wildly. Rook, I will
allow you a DEX save to dodge that sword, due to
the arrow.
Rook: (rolls) 12 — fail.
GM: It’s a big sword (rolls 6 dice). 1, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6.
DEATH BLOWWWWWWWWW!
Rook: I immediately mark usage on my helmet to
downgrade it to a Major Hit FFS.
Tess: I drop the bow and snatch up a burning
candle from the floor. I jam it toward his open visor
— fire in the face tends to ruin anyone’s day.
GM: Risky but clever — roll a DEX save to see if you
can hold your nerve that close.
Tess: (rolls) 7 — success.
GM: The wax splashes across his helm. Flames
bloom under the visor. The knight shrieks, staggering back. The smell of burning pitch fills the air as
the relic blade clatters to the stone floor.
The chapel falls silent once again.

5. HIRELINGS
Characters may attempt to hire retainers to join them in their travels and expeditions. In villages or small
settlements, roll d20 twice to determine which types are available. On 15-20, no one is available. If the
same number is rolled twice, the price of the allowance is halved. In big cities, all hirelings are available.

Allowance

Stats

Hirelings must receive their allowance at the
moment they are hired and at the start of each
subsequent gaming session. If
there are no funds available,
the hireling goes away.

Hirelings start with 6hp, a score of 6 in all attributes, and eight inventory slots, which can be used
as any character would. They are not equipped
unless otherwise noted. When the character who
hired them goes up a level, so do they. At each
level, hirelings gain 1 point to three attributes of
choice, plus 1 to their max hp.

If a character dies, its respective player may
resume play by recasting their hireling as a level 1
character of their chosen class, retaining any
attributes scores and max hp the hireling had at
that time.

Whenever a hireling is put under a potentially
harmful situation, or does not receive a share of
loot from a recent expedition, or is not fed properly,
their patron must make a CHA save. On a fail, the
hireling flees, taking all carried and stashed gear
with them.

57

6. CAMPAIGNING
FLAIL assumes a maximum level 5 for characters, which is usually reachable in around 15 sessions of play.
Player characters start at level 1. This does not mean longer campaigns cannot be played, but rather that a
renovation of cast is encouraged, in this way populating the setting or world as the game evolves.

Experience

Retiring

To go up a level, characters must obtain a number
of experience points equal to their current level.
For instance, at level 4, a character must gain four
points to advance to level 5. Points are typically
earned individually, but in cases like questing or
influencing, they may be granted to the entire party
if all contribute. Points can be obtained by:

When a character reaches level 6, they are retired
from play. Should the game continue, the GM is
encouraged to cast them in subsequent sessions
as notable NPCs.

• Looting: retrieving a Unique Item from a
hidden or remote location.
• Killing: dealing the final blow to a level 7+
creature.
• Questing: completing a mission (see Quest
Scenarios) for an NPC.
• Influencing: eliminating/thwarting a faction
OR helping it accomplish its goal.
• Surviving: committing a fabulously foolish
blunder and somehow surviving it, leaving the GM
with no alternative but to award an experience
point.
Optional: hardcore mode
To go up a level, players cannot repeat the same
‘method’ of earning an experience point until they
reach a new level.

Bard
Bone
Whisperer
Cleric
Cutthroat
Druid

58

Builds a skull tower or necropolis,
ruling the land and the dead within
its borders (usually one hex).
Erects a temple. The player can
choose four locations where their
religion has gained traction.
Takes over their guild or establish a
new one. The player can choose a
city for its base of operations.
Retires to appropriate biome to
become the protector of life within
its borders.

Tinkerer

Establishes a workshop and may
invent a new construct improvement. The player can choose a city
for its location.

Warrior

Takes over a castle and becomes a
baron, ruling the land within its borders (usually one hex).

Wizard

Builds a tower, becomes a master
and new apprentices flock in. The
player can choose the location of
the tower.

Gaining New Levels
When advancing, characters immediately restore
all hit points, remove conditions that require a
short or long rest to clear, and may try to raise two
attributes by beating their current base value on a
d20 roll – item bonuses do not count for this purpose. Skills that grant new spells, gadgets, instruments, talents and similar only take effect after the
character spends downtime in a city, or another
appropriate location, between sessions.

Establishes a school of music and
may design a new instrument. The
player can choose a city for its location.

“No one tells you the
tavern stories only get
worse when you stop
making them.”

Reputation
Reputation is measured via a bar from -6 to 6. Characters start at zero. This represents an ordinary person
with no social impact. Whenever a character does a popular deed, they increase the value by 1. Whenever
they do something unpopular, they decrease it by 1. The GM decides when an action qualifies for this.
• Famous: characters become famous when
their reputation reaches 6. Famous characters
are expected to solve social unrest, do heroic
actions and no longer have the option of
anonymity.

• Infamous: characters become infamous when
reputation drops to -6. Infamous characters are
persecuted by the authorities, suspected of
mischievous conduct and framed for
wrongdoings.

Examples of popular deeds

Examples of unpopular deeds

• Rescuing someone notable
• Saving a village
• Doing right by the authorities
• Paying taxes to the King
• Returning a lost object of value
• Slaying a dangerous creature

• Killing innocent folk
• Burning down a temple
• Deceiving the authorities
• Theft and robbery
• Backstabbing a prominent noble
• Desecrating tombs

From the moment a character is famous or infamous, all subsequent deeds are rewarded with a token. (Ex:
a character with 6 reputation that does two popular deeds gains two famous tokens.) Players can only hold
two tokens at once and may spend them to gain benefits. Use the examples below as inspiration.
Spending famous tokens

Spending infamous tokens

• Having free lodging and food in town
• Being easily received by local authorities
• Getting a referral from the local priest
• Hiring a retainer for free – a loyal virtuous one
• Receiving a rare gift

• Reaching out to the underworld for rumours
• Receiving help from a cult or thieves’ guild
• Hiring a retainer for free – a pesky vicious one
• Instilling fear, hindering folks from attacking
• Forcing rivals to lose at gambling on purpose

Things to consider…
Once famous or infamous, characters only stop being seen as
such when returning to reputation zero. However, they only
gain tokens if their reputation
stays at -6 or 6. Reputation
points should only be given
once/twice per session, so that
they take some time to become
relevant in play.

7. RUNNING FLAIL
Best Practices
• There are always ways to break the game,
whether it’s a spell that creates an overpowered
loophole with a skill, or a magic sword that shares
a dubious synergy with another item, or anything
in between. This can ruin the fun for everyone. Do
not allow it. Nerf at will.
• This game is now yours. Use what you like,
discard what you don’t. Rip it apart, put it back
together. These rules are not designed to cover
every imaginable situation; some aspects have
been kept vague to allow for improvisation. Adjust
one of the existing tools as needed when this
occurs, or create a new one. Keep track of it for
later use.
• Present paths, not destinations. Always give
players choices. Let them decide what to do and
where to go. Their decisions shape the world and
drive the story forward. Don’t push them down a
single path. Options should bear risks and
rewards. Encourage creativity and let their
choices bring the game to life.
• Set difficulty based on the situation, not just
mechanics. If something is truly impossible, no
roll can make it happen. When players take
actions that make sense, let it happen. But when
danger looms, make sure they know. Telegraph
the risks. Let them decide if they want to face the
challenge or find another way. And don't worry if
they kill a dragon with a single roll. There's always
a bigger dragon.
• Ask for saves when characters take brash
or potentially dangerous actions, as a result of
a player’s choice. Set the stakes before they
commit. Negotiate consequences if possible. ‘You
really wanna do that? Sure, but if you fail you’re
gonna take two conditions.’ Go back to page 51 for
a list of potential consequences.
62

• Reward ingenuity. When players are smart,
brave, and follow good leads, give them the
rewards they’ve earned. Don’t hold back after they
face real dangers and succeed. Rewards can
come in many forms—treasure, coins, powerful
items, valuable knowledge, or new clues that push
the story forward. Let their victories feel
meaningful.
• Inventory cycling. Characters are defined by
only by four skills and their inventory. Skills
evolve but don’t change at a fundamental level.
For the game to stay exciting, it's the inventory
that must change. Strict usage limits and costly
repairs ensure gear cycles, pushing players to
adapt to new items, strategies, and playstyles.
Even magic items wear down and are expensive
to repair, ensuring gear circulation.
GM Tracker Sheet
To manage time and exploration, FLAIL uses different time scales. Use the tracker sheet to keep
tabs on these units and manage resources, especially light sources and food.
• Overland travel: measured in watches; a
watch is eight hours long and is mostly used for
moving between hexes when hexcrawling.
• Dungeon exploration: usually measured in
turns; a turn is around ten minutes long, enough
for a major action, like exploring a room, disarming a trap, or fighting a monster.
• Combat: measured in rounds; a round is
about ten seconds long, enough for taking one
movement and an action.

Adventuring
There are three main ways in which a game of
FLAIL is designed to be played.
1. Hexcrawling
Hexcrawling is the default mode for campaign play
– a series of connected adventures throughout
various gaming sessions. In a hexcrawl, the game
world is represented by a map divided into hexes,
most of which contain a notable location or landmark.
This mode is built upon a sandbox-style experience, where the boundaries of the game world are
fluid, as both the GM and players build the setting
as they explore. Unlike scripted adventures, a hexcrawl gives players the freedom to make meaningful choices about where to go and what to do next.
The driving motto is to draw a story out of the players, not enforce one upon their characters. The
world doesn’t need to have every detail mapped
out. Instead, start small and flesh out locations as
they become relevant. Random encounter tables,
event generators, and a range of other tools allow
for the creation of gameable situations on the fly.
Try to incorporate players ideas and feedback as
much as possible. This will help in worldbuilding
while also making players feel accomplished.
Over time, a hexcrawl-based campaign can grow
into a living, breathing world. Villages might flourish or fall into ruin based on player actions. Powerful factions can rise or be overthrown. The
environment itself may change due to natural or
supernatural forces. Players might stumble upon
rumours of far-off lands or ancient evils, leading
them to seek out new regions. This ongoing process allows for deep world-building while maintaining a sense of spontaneity. GM and players know
that every decision can ripple out and shape the
world in unexpected ways.
This is the basic mode for campaigns in FLAIL.
Find more on the next page.

2. Quest Scenarios
Quest Scenarios, designed for a more focused
gameplay, are ideal for one-shot sessions. While
typically formatted as hexmaps, these are self-contained worlds to where the characters are thrown
into with a specific goal, such as retrieving an artifact, escaping a natural disaster, or stopping a villainous plan. The GM provides a clear objective to
the players, and the game is all about whether they
succeed or fail. Quest Scenarios allow for experimentation with new characters and mechanics
without long-term commitment. See page 72 for
more.
3. Dungeon Crawling
Dungeon crawling is a versatile mode that can be
used in ongoing hexcrawls or as standalone adventures. It focuses on the in-depth exploration of a
specific location, typically underground, like caves,
ancient ruins, or labyrinthine dungeons. Players
navigate enclosed environments filled with traps,
hidden passages, and puzzles with the aim of looting treasure, defeating powerful adversaries, or
solving a mystery hidden in the depths. Dungeons
can be used to flesh out locations within hexcrawls,
or to be played as one-off adventures. On page 78,
there are tools to generate Adventure Sites for dungeon crawling sessions.
Compatibility
Another way to use FLAIL is to play whatever oldschool oriented campaign or module you feel like.
It is simple to adapt such modules to the rules of
FLAIL; it mostly will come down to adapting monster stats and magic spells.

Cause I’ll go to Lankhmar. Heard the thieves

8. HEXCRAWL
Use these guidelines to create the starting hexcrawl for your campaign. If you’re playing a oneshot or single session, see ‘Quest Scenarios’.
The Hexcrawl Toolbox
Check out the Hexcrawl Toolbox, both the online
app or the physical boxset. It allows you to build
a hexcrawl in five minutes with 150 hex-tiles to
pick from.
Take me to the
online hexcrawl
app immediately
more at gamesomnivorous.com

1. Fill hexes
Print a blank hex-flower with 19 hexes. Fill 12 with a
location or landmark (or choose from the Hexcrawl
Toolbox). Write one or two lines for each, treating
them as if they were dungeon rooms: an ‘ancient
ruin’ does not need more than a brief description,
an obstacle to overcome (monster, trap, riddle) and
a reward, such as treasure. Use the tables on the
right to inspire yourself. Leave the other hexes
blank. These are useful to enforce travel rules, and
wilderness survival.
2. Adventure Sites
Expand one or two locations/landmarks into Adventure Sites using the tools in page 78 – or choose a
compatible module you like. How many depend on
the number of hours you envision for the starting
session of your campaign.
Note: most groups spend ten minutes per hex as
they deal with encounters or make plans. A 19-hex
map will take around three hours to be explored.
Each detailed site should generate an additional
one or two hours of play.

3. Rumours
Create a table of d6 rumours and introduce them to
players at the start of the game. Rumours drive
exploration and often turn into quests or adventure
hooks. Let players find their own adventure. Use
the table in the next page to inspire yourself.
• Entries 1-3 should be true
• Entries 4-5 should partially true
• Entry 6 should be false
4. Events
Create a list of d4 events. Events are something
that may tip the scales in the region or impact
characters in a significant way, like a shift in power
or a natural disaster. Be upfront about these to the
players. Use the table as inspiration to create more.
5. Factions
Create two factions, using the table as a guide. Give
each a clear goal with a significant impact on the
region, and a key resource. If there are player characters belonging to a thieves’ guild or religious
order, think about how the factions can interact
with these (see page 67).
6. Encounters
Create a table of d8 encounters. Use them to populate the wilderness, create adversity, and spice up
locations not detailed in step 2. Combine creatures
from the bestiary, with faction encounters and
groups of people travelling.
7. Treasure
Mark four hexes as bearing legendary treasure. If
successfully explored, reward characters with a
Unique Item (page 98). Reward the exploration of
other locations with coin or mundane wealth.

Factions represent forces that exert influence over a number of hexes or even the entire map. Players can
interact with them in various way – such as hindering their progress, assisting them, or striking deals. Generate two factions using the table above and complete them by using the following guidelines:
• Name: give each faction a unique, memorable name.
• Homebase: choose one hex as each faction’s base.
• Goal: ask how the goal can be accomplished, what is still missing, its ultimate purpose, and where it
might be accomplished. Tie some answers to locations on the map.
• Competition: have each faction compete for one hex and think why.

Running the Hexcrawl
Basics
Start the party in a hex of your choosing. Exploration is divided into three watches per day (morning,
afternoon, evening) of eight hours each.
Crossing a hex
It takes two watches to move from one hex into
another. Fast vehicles or mounts reduce this to one
watch, while slow vehicles or rough terrain (such as
rivers, cliffs, or flooded lands) add an extra watch.
Roll 2d6 when moving into a new hex and apply the
appropriate result.
2-5
6-9

Roll encounter.
Nothing occurs.
Lost! Watch is wasted.
Bad trail! Move into another hex.
Roll Event.

Exploring a location
If a hex has a location, characters may wish to
explore it. Exploration takes a watch, though possibly longer depending on the players’ approach. If
the location has not been detailed as an Adventure
Site, consider the following practices:
• Description: improvise tactile details and
come up with an obstacle or interaction
(example: ‘this Ancient Ruin has a sealed door
covered in glyphs,’ or ‘the wizard inside this Tower
needs to strike a deal’). Use player reactions or
ask questions, then expand on their feedback.
• City, Village, Temple: expand any of these
locations following the procedures in the
Resources chapter. They can be used on the fly.
• Encounters: roll encounters to flesh out
location occupants or generate conflict. Adversity
leads to adventure.
• Treasure: choose a treasure as reward for
exploring the location; it may give ideas as to why
this place is relevant.
• Rumours: flesh out the location by making it
the subject of a known rumour.
68

Gathering supplies
Characters may spend a watch gathering food and
consumables (like natural medicine, reagents, wood
for arrows, etc.). Roll d6. On a success, they find d6
supplies. On a 1, roll encounter.

wave; in Mountains, icy winds, etc.)

Expanding the Campaign
When all (or most) hexes have been explored, it is
time to expand the current hexcrawl. Follow these
procedures, namely in-between sessions:
• Hexes: add 12 new hexes to the current map,
repeating step 1 (page 64).
• Adventure Sites: detail more locations as per
step 2 (page 78).
• Quest Scenarios: alternatively, send
characters on quests (page 72) by having an NPC
hire them for a mission.
• Faction progression: if characters did not
hinder a faction, roll d6. On 4-6, the faction
advances one step closer in its goal. After three
advances, it succeeds. Adjust the campaign
accordingly, adding the appropriate
consequences and changes to the world. Then,
remove the faction from play. They have ‘won’.
• New factions: create new factions as you
expand the map with new hexes.
• Encounters: swap some encounters out for
new ones to keep exploration unpredictable.
• Rumours: swap some of the rumours, focusing
on the ones that interest the party as the
campaign evolves.
• Events: update the events table with new ones
if all have been triggered.

Retired Characters
Characters are designed to retire upon completing level 5. They become important NPCs. Play
can continue in the same world/setting by having
the players roll new characters, incorporating
retried ones as key NPCs and carrying on.

The world is generated as the game is played. This
design encourages the GM and players to create an
evolving world by combining multiple hexcrawls (or
expanding the original one), sending players to new
regions (adding the respective hexes), detailing
more adventure locations and progressing the factions. Keep track of the map. The setting is formed
while players play the game.

Inscribed with four wizard spells. Each takes one
watch to transcribe and one week to learn.

9. QUEST SCENARIOS
Quest Scenarios are designed for an action-packed
one-shot, where characters have a clear objective
and time to complete it.
1. Theme
Pick a core objective from the table, define it further by answering the related question, and create
a key twist using those listed as inspiration. Make
the quest time-sensitive: a good one-shot adventure has a sense of urgency to keep the players on
track. Anywhere between one and two weeks is a
good guide.
2. Build a map
Print a blank grid containing 20~25 hexes. Fill half
of them with a location or landmark (or pick tiles
from the Hexcrawl Toolbox). Write one or two lines
for each as you would for a regular hexcrawl, using
the tables on the Hexcrawl chapter to generate
content. Link some of them to the quest’s goal.
3. Encounters
Create a table of d6 encounters. Link a few with the
theme of the quest. Examples: if the goal is to stop
a ritual, add a wandering cultist in search of a
missing ingredient; if the goal is to transport goods,
add a rival merchant gang; if the goal is to find a
particular location, add a pirate bearing a treasure
map.

4. Events (optional)
Create a thematic table of events with custom
rules. These can range from events that happen
every day to others that are triggered like in a
normal hexcrawl. Examples: if the goal is to stop a
ritual, add events that advance it; if the goal is to
save a village, add events that advance the village’s
doom.
5. Special rules (optional)
Add a custom set of rules that makes the scenario
unique. Examples: on a natural disaster scenario,
design rules for when a hex is affected by it; on a
hunt quest, create rules for when a marked location
is explored. Check the pre-made Quest Scenarios
for inspiration.
6. Treasure
Mark between three and six locations as bearing
legendary treasure. If explored successfully, reward
players with a Unique Item (page 98).
7. The Quest
Give players the quest, and play to see if they are
successful.

Running Scenarios
Define a starting hex for the characters. Run the scenarios like regular hexcrawls, except for the custom
events and special rules. Since this mode of play does not suggest to expand locations into Adventure
Sites, simply narrate the location’s content and use players reactions – or ask them questions – and build
on their feedback. Remember that these locations do not need more than an overall description, an
obstacle, possibly an encounter and some sort of reward.

Curse of the
Dreadmarsh Witch
The Quest: gather five ingredients and brew an elixir to lift a curse.
Characters didn’t just steal
any cat; they took Mirelda
the Dreadmarsh Witch’s
beloved familiar – and then
sold it to Kazmora, the Collector (facepalm). The
witch has, of course, cursed them with the
Dreadmarsh Blight, which
is slowly twisting their
bodies into reflections of
the swamp itself—bones
creaking like old trees,
skin cracking like dried
mud, and voices gurgling
like the bog's depths. Their
only hope is to gather five
rare ingredients and
brew a cleansing elixir.
Can they succeed before
they’re fully made into
creatures of the swamp?
Note: players should
know which ingredients
they need and where they
are. But not necessarily
how to get them or how
to brew them.

theme. Alternatively, draw ten squares on a piece of
paper, spacing them across the page. Connect them
with lines, ensuring at least three have multiple connections to create varied paths for exploration.
2. Encounters & Treasure
Create a d6 encounter table. Whenever a room is
entered, roll d6. On a 6, roll a random encounter. On
a 1, roll a random treasure.
• Entries 1-3: weak foes. One matching the
theme creatures, one related to the key feature,
and a random the third (robbers, rivals, etc).
• Entries 4-5: average foes. One matching the
rolled theme, the other random.

Key ten areas. Identify prominent rooms, corridors,
or dead-ends, numbering them from one to ten,
one being the entrance and ten the big finale. Stock
each area with one of the following concepts,
repeating the one that feels more appropriate:
• Something to steal: choose a Unique Item
(page 98) as the key reward of the dungeon. Add a
complication to secure it, like a trap, encounter or
small puzzle.
• Something that probably won’t be found: a
weird magic item, spellbook, or a cache of gold
tucked away in a secret room that is hard to spot.
• Something the characters can kill: weak
encounter matching the rolled theme (can be
already in the encounters table).
• Something that can kill the characters: a
strong adversary (can be the same from
encounters table). Offer the players a chance to
flee or side-step.
• Someone to meet: talking statue, ghost, rival
gang, lost wizard, goblin prisoner. Someone the
players can interact or bargain with.
• Puzzle to play with: roll on the table.
• Obstacle to overcome: roll on the table.
• Trap to avoid: roll on the table.
• Odd anomaly: roll on the table.

city, toxic vapours, undead.

1: Entrance
Sewer-filled alleys reek of refuse and toxic vapours.
• Roll d6 for which entrance is used.
• d4 Sea Snakes prowl the canals, hunting prey.
• Make a STR save for each turn spent within the
sewer waters. On a fail, take a Nauseated
condition (clear: throw up and lose 1 STR until the
next day). (Obstacle to overcome)
2: Abandoned Quarters
A lovely rainbow trail disappears into a tight
crawlspace, glowing faintly.
• Characters of average build must leave behind
stashed items to squeeze through.
• A Unique Item is tucked behind barrels.
(Something to steal)
• A Prismatic Slug nests here. Not even the Lich
King wants to deal with this.
3: Dead-End
Echoing whispers, a corpse lies on the floor.
• Ghost of a victim harvested by the Lich King
wanders about. Reveals the Sultan’s secret, if
their body is buried.
• Secret: the Sultan is sacrificing denizens to
the Lich King in exchange for a Ring of Youth. The
Lich is using the souls of the citizens to forge the
ring, but the victims' bodies are being twisted into
ghouls to expand his undead army. The Sultan is
unaware of this tragedy. (Someone to meet)

6: Giant Toadstools
A corpse rots amidst an overgrown fungi garden.
• If cut, the fungi release toxins. STR save or
take Poisoned condition. (Odd anomaly)
• The corpse bears a dagger, rope, pick-axe,
improvised mask, and 2d20 coins.
7: Bandit Hideout
Door is locked.
• Abandoned stash of rusty weapons, counterfeit
coins (INT save to appraise) and makeshift cots.
• Cache of coins (6d100) concealed under a
false floor slab by bandits, before they were
captured and harvested by the Lich King.
(Something that probably won’t be found)
8: Chamber of Souls
Human bones coat the walls, encircling an imposing
throne made of skulls.
• The Lich King is wearing a crown, harvesting
two victims, their spirits writhing in agony. The
victims’ souls feed into a reliquary that is used to
empower the ring. (Something that can kill the
characters)
• Crown: those who wear it may control weak
undead creatures, but take d8 damage per turn,
turning into a Lich King themselves if their hit
points drop below zero.

4: Ghoul Barracks
Ghoulish sounds echo all around.
• d4 Ghouls in each room, roaming aimlessly
awaiting instructions. (Something the characters
can kill)

9: Necro-Workshop
A ring hovers, suspended by dark energy.
• The Ring of Eternal Youth is nearly complete!
Prevents aging while worn, but each time it is
removed, the wearer ages d10 years instantly.
Worth 600 coins to the right buyer. (Something to
steal)

5: Skeleton Statues
Two symmetrical statues of crowned skeletons rise
amidst the fumes.
• The statutes’ hands (marked with a star) point
north and south. If rotated to point to the secret
door in the corridor, the door will open. (Puzzle to
play with)
• Faint screams can be hard coming from the
Chamber of Souls through the walls.

10: Royal Gaol
Locked door; screams for help come from within.
• Turning the doorknob releases a ghostly hand
that siphons 2d4 hit points, transferring them to
the Lich King, if still alive. (Trap to avoid)
• Inside, captured citizens await their fate,
unaware they are to be sacrificed for the Sultan’s
greed. They will turn into allies immediately if
promised freedom.

1. Generate wizard
Create a wizard by setting their level between 6 and
10 (only high-level mages have their own towers), as
well as hit points (10-20), saves value, morale, and
mana (20-30). Choose five fitting spells for them,
and a name.
3. Façade
Pick a façade and check the numbers showing on
each floor, which represent the general type of the
floor. Then, roll a d4 for each individually to
determine the exact nature of the floor. Finally,
write a couple of key features or prominent objects
that characters can find or interact with in each
floor.

2. Build tower
Roll a handful of d6s (between four and six depending on how many levels you want) and stack them
atop each without looking. Roll a d4 and add it to
the top of the stack. This is the tower.
4. Top floor
Check the number rolled on the d4 that tops the
stack. The top floor is an:
• (1) astronomical observatory,
• (2) meditation pod,
• (3) light-prism beacon,
• (4) eldritch lookout.
Write down a purpose for it.

Example: if the
chosen façade
is the one on the
right, the 1st floor
would be a gallery,
the 2nd floor a chamber, the 3rd floor a
leisure room, the 4th
floor another chamber and the top floor
an eldritch lookout.

Then, a d4 would be
rolled for each floor to
determine the type of
gallery, chamber, etc.

1. Layout
Drop a handful of d6s onto a page. Draw a circle around each die as well as lines connecting them. The
circles represent chambers, whereas the lines are tunnels. Ensure that at least two chambers have two
tunnels to create multiple exploration paths. Connect two non-adjacent chambers to form a longer tunnel.
Draw a map if you wish.
• Entry: the die closest to the edge of paper is the entrance.
• Core: the die closest to the centre of the page is the largest chamber.
• Hidden: a die landing off the paper represents a secret chamber, accessible through rougher
passages (roll twice on step 3). It bears lost treasure in addition to other features.
• Cluster: dice landing close to each other, sharing the same number, form a clustered area.

11. BESTIARY
Use creatures to generate adversity. The ones listed here serve mostly as inspiration for creating new
adversaries for the characters. When a creature lists Any hit, Major Hit, or Death Blow in an attack, that
effect occurs in addition to the default combat consequences, unless otherwise noted. Any hit means the
effect occurs with a Minor Hit, Major Hit or Death Blow. Adversaries can make one attack per round unless
specified differently.
Breakdown of adversary stats:
• level: their overall power. Particularly relevant
for certain spells or effects.
• hp: the amount of hit points they have. Remove
from play if it reaches zero.
• Saves: if an effect requires an adversary to
make a save (of any kind except Morale), they
must roll equal or under the listed value to
succeed.
• Defence: subtract the shown value from any
damage taken.
• Movement: slow (S) adversaries must choose
between moving or taking an action per round;
fast (F) adversaries can make two moves and
take an action in the same round; those that are
average (A) act similarly to player characters.

• Morale: should any effect ask of an adversary
to make a Morale save, they must roll equal or
under the listed value to succeed.
• Type: type may be relevant for certain spells,
magic items or special skills.
• Attacks: adversaries can have various attacks.
The GM should not use the same twice in a row.
• TH: amount of d6s the adversary uses to roll a
To Hit.
• DMG: amount of damage the adversary can
make.
• Special: unusual or unique trait of the
adversary.

limited to:
• Different types of attacks with variable TH
and DMG values.
• Multiple attacks per round, especially for
stronger creatures.
• An interesting Major Hit effect.
• A special Death Blow that replaces forcing a
Death Table roll.

12. UNIQUE ITEMS
Unique Items are powerful items that characters
find by delving into dungeons and similar. It is also
possible to trade or acquire them, at the GM’s discretion, but experience points are only awarded by
retrieving them from a hidden or remote location.
Unique Items can be used by any class, but armour
and weapon restrictions still apply. For example, a
Bard would take a -1 TH penalty for wielding The
Intimidator, but Molten Fury or the Serpent’s Dance
is probably fine. Use common sense to determine
whether a certain class has a penalty for using a
legendary weapon or a unique piece of armour.
Negotiate with the players if needed.
The only exception is Set Items. These are specifically designed for certain classes. Set Items are
groups of equippable gear that, when worn or carried together unlock new abilities or boost skills. On
pages 104-107, there are example sets. Use them as
inspiration to create more.

Usage
Characters must roll usage for each weapon used
after combat, or mark it immediately if the items
requires it. Dots on items that don’t require usage
can be marked when used oddly or as a cost of a
failed save. To clear usage dots, characters must
find a specialised smith, wizard or alchemist, and
pay 25% of its value per dot.

CREATING UNIQUE ITEMS
To create a new Unique Item of your own, use the
following ideas as inspiration. Unique Items often
bend rules in favour of the characters, like
bypassing class restrictions or conferring them
bonuses.
• Improve TH by 1.
• Improve DMG by 1.
• Extra usage dots to improve durability.
• Bypass class restrictions (weapon specialty or
armour proficiency).
• Thematic Major Hit or Death Blow effects.
• +1 to an attribute of choice.
• +1 or 2 to max hit points.
• Resistance to certain elements.
• Advantage in certain actions.
• Access to magic spells.

Animals
Characters can attempt to befriend animals. This requires four saves over one week (once every two days).
Players may choose which attribute to use, representing different methods (brute force with STR, leadership with CHA, playfulness with DEX, etc). Failing one save makes the animal go away. Bone Whisperer and
Wizard animals are considered familiars, becoming telepathically-linked with each other. Animals have
base 4hp, 6 to all attributes, and can perform basic natural tasks, besides conferring a bonus or skill.

Potions
Only the very fool or the very wise have the nerve to mix
To create potions, characters must mix between three and five ingredients using different reagents –
mixing the same reagents creates a bland goo. Then, the GM randomly rolls a potion from the respective
table. From that moment on, every time the same ingredients are mixed, characters get the potion previously rolled, representing they have learned a recipe. Potions usually have three usages dots. Mark usage
each item they are drank.
Chemicals
Essences
Extracts
Herbs
Remains

Ingredients
Acid
Basilisk Venom
Goblin Earwax
Belladonna
Cyclops Eye

Arsenic
Dragon Bile
Lich Dust
Mandrake
Giant’s Toe

Quicksilver
Kraken Ink
Ogre Fat
Mugwort
Griffon Claw

Saltpetre
Vitriol
Mermaid Tear Slime Mucus
Phoenix Feather Troll Fart
Valerian
Wolfsbane
Hydra Scale
Wraith Dust

Use these ingredients and the potions on the right as inspiration to create more. If characters find or hire
an alchemist, they may learn three recipes. The GM should roll three potions and determine the ingredients
needed for them.
• Chemicals: can be purchased in big cities for 4d10 coins per dose.
• Herbs: can be foraged in the wilderness.
• Essences, extracts & remains: must be procured through adventuring.
Note: the GM can openly tell the players the exact effects of potions, if they wish. Through playtesting, it
was funnier to allow characters to discover a potion’s properties through adventuring. Note that weak
potions can have undesired effects, thus if the first option is used, we advise removing them from play.

1. Create a name
Think of an appropriate name, combining any two
theme outputs. Say the rolls included ‘dragonkin
matriarchy’ and ‘every resident has a twin’ – The
City of the Dragon Twins; the rolls included ‘shifting
maze walls’ and ‘all buildings are pink’ – Pink-Maze
Port.

whereas randomly displayed ones convey a chaotic
mess of alleyways. Cards placed atop each other
represent structures cluttered atop each other. The
number of cards dictates how big the city is:

2. Lay cards
Pick up a standard deck of cards. Take out the Ace
of Heats. This structure is always present. Separate
each suit and shuffle it individually, creating four
piles. Then, keep on drawing cards from any pile,
placing them face-up on the gaming table. The
cards represent locations in the city, the spaces
between them are streets. Lay them out as you
wish. Create thematic districts by placing cards of
the same suit next to each other. Orthogonally
placed cards convey a neatly organized city,

3. Stocking buildings
Check the tables two pages below. Each suit represents a category, each number corresponds to a
location within that category. Improvise details as
characters explore the city, taking note of their
details. Roll d4 for variants of the location.

• Small cities: 20 cards
• Average cities: 30 cards
• Metropolis: 40+ cards

4. Remember the city
Once you built a city, take note of it. This city is
now part of the world. Characters know what the
city has and offers, so they might return.
